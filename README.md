# Build In Amsterdam Group Project
A Clone with more features than the original site. This project takes content and layout from [Build In Amsterdam's](http://www.buildinamsterdam.com) Portfolio site. Their site was built with WordPress and looks nice, but has flaws and limitations due to WordPresses templates. Our goal is to present this site in a React framed environment which with component based architecture can allow smoother animation and presentation as well as editability with admin privileges.
